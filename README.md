# Converting Matty's Tokenomics Book to eBook

[This tokenomics guide](https://tokenomics-guide.notion.site/tokenomics-guide/Tokenomics-for-Builders-The-Comprehensive-Practitioner-s-Guide-to-Token-b5154feba117415cafd67678355e317b) looks so incredibly comfy, I really wanted to tuck in with it on my Kindle.

I thought it was something I could knock out in a couple hours, but it's taking a bit longer. Rather than give up, I figure I'd post it and see if anyone wants to help.

It's probably a waste of time since Matty could just export it from Notion as a PDF. But hey, sometimes these little challenges are a nice change of pace.

## What needs to be done

Here's the basic steps:

1. Copy the markdown from Notion and paste it in one file
1. To make the titles register as chapters, tweak the headings a bit so only chapter titles are h1
1. Save all the images locally and update the image links in the markdown file
1. Convert the final markdown file to `.mobi` and `.epub`
1. Make sure it all looks nice with [Kindle Previewer](https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Previewer/b?node=21381691011)

I got the first two steps and started dorking around with the next ones. I did some super low-effort coding to automate steps 3 and 4. In the end I think both of those are better to just do manually.
